(1) Take our existing Person class, and add a subclass, called
    VerbosePerson.  This class works the same way as Person, except that
    the "greet" method doesn't just return "Hello, NAME" but rather
    something longer than that.

(2) Take our existing ShoppingCart class.  Create a subclass called
    OnlineShoppingCart.  In this case, the "total" method will add
    another $10 + 5% of the total for shipping costs.

(3) Take our existing Bowl class (for ice cream), and create a
    subclass called BigBowl.  A BigBowl is just like a Bowl, except
    that it has a maximum of 5 scoops, not 3.
