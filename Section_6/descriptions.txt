(1) Make it possible to run len() on our Bowl/BigBowl objects.  This
    will report the number of scoops in a bowl.

    b = Bowl()
    b.add_scoops(s1, s2, s3)
    len(b)  # return 3

(2) Make it possible to "print" our Scoop and Bowl.  If I say

    print(s1)

    it'll print

    Scoop of chocolate

    mylist = [s1, s2, s3]

    print(mylist)

     [Scoop of chocolate, Scoop of vanilla, Scoop of coffee]

    print(b)

    Bowl with:
1) Scoop of chocolate
2) Scoop of vanilla
2) Scoop of coffee

(3) Make len() and print() work on the Shopping Cart.  If I say
    len(sc), it'll return the number of items in the cart.

    print(sc)

    It'll show each item in the cart -- name, per-unit price,
    quantity, and total price for that item.  *PLUS* it'll show the
    total price of all items

    item1    2    $1    $2
    item2    6    $3    $18
    -----------------------
    Total               $20
